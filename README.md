# Pacman-AI-Project
I have developed a Python program that utilizes AI search algorithms to tackle challenges in the Berkeley Pac-Man environment. These projects, created at UC Berkeley, apply AI principles to the well-known arcade game. My program assists Pac-Man in locating food, evading ghosts, and optimizing his game score through various techniques such as uninformed and informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning.

# Phase 1
In this phase the Pacman AI Project features a collection of implemented search algorithms:
- BFS and DFS
- UCS
- A* Search
- Greedy Search

# Phase 2
The primary focus of this phase revolves around crafting AI agents that skillfully orchestrate Pacman's movements. These agents deftly employ diverse strategies tailored to accomplish distinct objectives, including the meticulous collection of all food dots, the artful evasion of ghosts, and the astute optimization of the game's score.
Algorithms and agents:
- Reflex Agent
- Minimax agent
- Alpha-beta pruning
- Expectimax agent

# Phase 3
In this phase the main focus is on Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcemenet Learning to understand the concepts of states, actions, rewards, and transitions in decision-making scenarios, aand to explore the basics of reinforcement learning and Q-learning algorithms.
- Search Algorithms
- Adversarial Search:
- Policy Iteration
- Epsilon greedy
- Value Iteration and Asynchronous value iteration
- Q-Learning
- Approximate Q-Learning
